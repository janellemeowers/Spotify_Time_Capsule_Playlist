# Spotify_Time_Capsule_Playlist
Using Spotify for Developers, Spotipy, and Beautiful Soup, creates a playlist of the Billboard 100 in my Spotify account when inputing a certain date in the console.

Does hearing a certain song instantly take you back in time? By entering a date, this project creates a playlist of the Billboard 100 songs from that date.

This was a fun way to put webscraping Beautifl Soup to use.By accessing the Billboard 100 lists, I was able to scrape the song titles from the date URL. I also became familiar with Spotify's dev tools and authorization process. 
Spotipy also makes it easier to access the song data. 
Challenges: Understanding new documentation for both Spotify and Spotipy because it's not always clear what I need and do not need to use, and the best way to find the data I needed.
